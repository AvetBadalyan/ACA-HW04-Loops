# Loops and Array Methods

## 1. Odd or even

## 8. Reverse first and last digits of number

Insert a number. Print ‘yesʼ if the number is prime, ‘noʼ otherwise.

[08. reverse.js](https://github.com/AvetBadalyan/ACA-HW04-Loops/blob/main/08.%20reverse.js)

## 9. Insert a number. Print ‘yesʼ if the number is prime, ‘noʼ otherwise.

[09. isPrime.js](https://github.com/AvetBadalyan/ACA-HW04-Loops/blob/main/09.%20isPrime.js)

## 10. Given a number n ( n >= 0 ) . Print n Fibonacci number. (Fibonacci th series: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8

Given a number n ( n >= 0 ) . Print n Fibonacci number. (Fibonacci th series: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8

[10. Fibonacci.js](https://github.com/AvetBadalyan/ACA-HW04-Loops/blob/main/10.%20Fibonacci.js)

## 11. Calculate product and sum of digits of number

Insert a number. Calculate product and sum of the digits of the number. If product is divisible by the
sum, print the quotient, otherwise print the remainder.

[11. productSum.js](https://github.com/AvetBadalyan/ACA-HW04-Loops/blob/main/11.%20productSum.js)

## 12. Replace word to sentence

Given a sentence with missing words and an array of words. Replace all ‘\_ʼ in a sentence with the
words from the array.

[12 fillMissingWords.js](https://github.com/AvetBadalyan/ACA-HW04-Loops/blob/main/12%20fillMissingWords.js)

## 13. Filter array of numbers from other symbols

Given mixed array of numbers, strings, booleans, nulls and undefined. Filter array and get all the
numbers in a separate array. Arrange them such as from the beginning are the odds and from the
ending the evens.

[13. filter numbers.js](https://github.com/AvetBadalyan/ACA-HW04-Loops/blob/main/13.%20filter%20numbers.js)

## 14. Count strings and number in array

Given an array of strings and numbers. Print the number of integers and the number of strings in the
array.

[14. countNumsAndStrings.js](https://github.com/AvetBadalyan/ACA-HW04-Loops/blob/main/14.%20countNumsAndStrings.js)

## 15. Count length of values from array

Given an array of strings. Find the strings with maximum and minimum lengths in array. Print the sum
// of their lengths.

[15. lengthOfStrings.js](https://github.com/AvetBadalyan/ACA-HW04-Loops/blob/main/15.%20lengthOfStrings.js)

## 16. Find index in array by val of digit

Given an array of numbers and a number. Find the index of a first element which is equal to that
number. If there is not such a number, that find the index of the first element which is the closest to it.

[16. findIndexByValue.js](https://github.com/AvetBadalyan/ACA-HW04-Loops/blob/main/16.%20findIndexByValue.js)

## 17. Remove symbol from words in array

Given a sentence as a string. Split it according to space and comma and create an array consisting of
the words of the array. The last word should not contain the last . or ! .

[17. splitString.js](https://github.com/AvetBadalyan/ACA-HW04-Loops/blob/main/17.%20splitString.js)

## 18. Create new array by value of given array

Given an array of a size smaller than 100. It consists of numbers from 0 to 99 in any order. Create a
new array where each element from that array is placed under the index of its value. Start from the
smallest value and end with the biggest one. If there are missing values, put in its places undefined.

[18. till100.js](https://github.com/AvetBadalyan/ACA-HW04-Loops/blob/main/18.%20till100.js)

## 19. Sum digit in sub array in other array

Given an array consisting from the arrays of numbers (like a two-dimensional array). Find sum of each
row and print them as an array.

[19. sumOfMatrix.js](https://github.com/AvetBadalyan/ACA-HW04-Loops/blob/main/19.%20sumOfMatrix.js)
